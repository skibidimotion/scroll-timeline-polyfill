# scroll-timeline-polyfill

Import via https://skibidimotion.github.io/scroll-timeline-polyfill/scroll-timeline-polyfill.js.

Forked from https://flackr.github.io/scroll-timeline/dist/scroll-timeline.js (https://github.com/flackr/scroll-timeline). Made overscroll behavior uniform for both directions of each axis. Unclear whether original inconsistency is isolated to the polyfill or inherited from the spec.
