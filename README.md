# scroll-timeline-polyfill

Forked from [http://flackr.github.io/scroll-timeline/dist/scroll-timeline.js] ([https://github.com/flackr/scroll-timeline]). Changed overscroll behavior to be uniform for both directions of each axis. Unclear whether original inconsistency is isolated to the polyfill or inherited from the spec.
